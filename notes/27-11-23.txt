Epoch 100/100, Train Loss: 0.5609, Train Acc: 84.16%, Val Loss: 0.6332, Val Acc: 81.55%

Notes

• There is a consistent improvement over time with training and validation accuracies;
  training accuracy improved from 72.41% to 84.16% and a similar increase with
  validation accuracy (the model is learning and not just memorising training data)

• Training and validation accuracies are improving alongside each other with a narrow
  gap between them, so model is not overfitting significantly

• High validation accuracy is impressive considering the complexity of amino acid
  sequences, but this is just speculation until I can actually use and test the
  model

• Training and validation losses are decreasing steadily and appears to not be
  slowing down anytime soon

• No signs of overfitting that would be apparent by a high training accuracy but
  low validation accuracy
